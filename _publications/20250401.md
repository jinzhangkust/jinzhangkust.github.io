excerpt: 'Froth flotation is a widely employed mineral beneficiation technique, and effective process monitoring is critical for optimizing mineral separation. However, in the industrial process, labeling froth images to create large labeled datasets is both expensive and time-consuming. Semi-supervised deep learning offers a promising solution, but leveraging unlabeled data remains a significant challenge. To this aim, we propose an uncertainty-aware semi-supervised contrastive learning method. Our approach employs a pseudo-labeling module with dropout to generate pseudo labels and estimate uncertainty. Based on the uncertainty scores, the pseudo-labeled data are split into reliable and unreliable sets. A semi-supervised contrastive learning module is developed to exploit pseudo-label information and learn class-aware representations from the reliable set. Additionally, a dynamically weighted consistency learning module is introduced to explore potential classification information in the unreliable data while preventing the model from being misled by low-confidence predictions. Comparison experiments on industrial zinc flotation data show our method achieves 88.12% classification accuracy, surpassing the best alternative by a margin of 5.11%. These results demonstrate that our method generalizes well to unseen test data and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.'
