excerpt: 'Froth flotation is a widely used mineral beneficiation technique, where effective process monitoring is essential for optimizing mineral separation. However, in practical industry, manual labeling suffers from noises, leading to a significant portion of incorrectly labeled data. Though deep learning monitoring models are powerful in capturing complex visual patterns, their high capacity makes them vulnerable to overfitting noisy labels, hindering robust model development. To address this challenge, this study proposes a noise-robust contrastive ensemble learning method for practical industrial process monitoring. The method first constructs multiple diverse monitoring models in distinct representation spaces using a novel disparity contrastive learning strategy. Then, clean and mislabeled data for each sub-model are distinguished by measuring the inter-model consensus and intra-model uncertainty of its peer models. Finally, a structure-consistency-based semi-supervised learning strategy is proposed to refine these sub-models by treating mislabeled data as unlabeled, encouraging representation-aligned predictions through mutual information maximization. Through iterative noisy-label identification and semi-supervised refinement, robust monitoring model are obtained even with heavily corrupted training data. Extensive experiments on industrial froth flotation data demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method compared to existing state-of-the-art noise-robust learning techniques.'
